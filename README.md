✨ Leetcode_Newbie: The Training Ground ✨
👋 Hey there, and welcome to my LeetCode practice space!

This repository is where I document my journey solving problems using Python 🐍 and SQL 💾.

My main goals are crystal clear:

🚀 To level up my algorithmic thinking and deep understanding of data structures, making sure my coding fundamentals are rock solid! 💪

💼 Ultimately, this journey is all about preparing for my future career in data engineering or analysis! Getting job-ready, one problem at a time. 🌟

🤝 Let's Learn and Grow Together!
If you're also crushing LeetCode challenges or have a super-cool, optimized solution for one of these problems, please feel free to reach out and discuss!

I'd love to connect with fellow coding enthusiasts! Together, we can go from Newbie to Pro!

🎉 Keep Coding & Stay Awesome! 🎉
