# 环形数组(circular array) + 单调栈
# we don't need to recurately replicate the array
# Firstly, we can imagine replicating the array once, just put the replicated one right after the old one
#     then we can learn all the features of connecting itself repeadly
#     space complexity: o(n); time complexity O(1)
# Then, a smarter way is to use %
